    <a href="https://neet.mit.edu/">The New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET)</a> is an experimental curriculum at MIT designed to be completed alongside student's degree(s). It focuses on hands-on experience to prepare students for industry.
</p>
<p>
    The Autonomous machines thread is section of NEET devoted to all things autonomous. Students work with drones, cars, and buggies and have special access to professors and labs working in the field. They are required to take a series of classes designed focusing on autonomy. 
</p>
<p>
    Autonomous machines integrate mechanical and informational components by combining the physical constraints of a vehicle with the control, planning, navigation, and perception algorithms required to make them operate independently. The creation of an effective autonomous vehicle requires knowledge of kinematics, dynamics, modeling, control, simulation, design, electronics, sensors, algorithms, software, human-robot interaction, systems engineering, and experimentation.
</p>
<p>
    Participants in Autonomous Machines will get hands-on experience in all of these disciplines through a series of projects with escalating complexity. Starting with individual projects in small-scale software design for embedded microcontrollers, they then move on to team-level design of perception and planning for automated quadrotors or cars. Finally, the entire class will build a scaled and automated mobility-on-demand system as a semester-long project in the senior year.

<p>
    Students go through a three year currciculum consisting of fall seminar and spring 12 unit classes, as well as additional reccomended supplementary classes. All of these classes are intended to allow students to hone skills related to autonomy. The seminars are specially designed to familiarize students with the platforms that form the basis of their spring classes. For sophomores and juniors, these classes are variants of existing MIT classes that are being taught with extra support to allow students to focus on advanced autonomy concepts. Seniors complete a large, free form project in a capstone course. More information on past years' classes can be found in the projects section of the site.

    Students are invited to apply for this thread at the end of their first year and beginning of their sophomore year. Keep an eye out for when applications open in the spring! Questions about applications and eligibility can be directed to Greg Long.
